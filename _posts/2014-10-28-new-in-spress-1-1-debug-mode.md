A debug mode can be activated with Spress 1.1 according with [issue #17](https://github.com/spress/Spress/issues/17)
from [@valllabh](https://github.com/valllabh). With this mode activated you can
[dump](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/functions/dump.html) information about a template
variable in your templates. By default debug mode is disabled. To enable add this line in `config.yml` of your
site:

```
debug: true
```

To dumps information about a variable simply uses `dump` function from Twig:

{% verbatim %}
```
<pre>{{ dump(page) }}</pre>
```
{% endverbatim %}

Enjoy it!
